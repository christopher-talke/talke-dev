Okay, so I've been keeping my "finger on the pulse" for the <a href="https://dogehouse.tv">https://dogehouse.tv</a> since Ben Awad also known as the "AngularJS Connoisseur" has been posting about it on Twitter and his Youtube Channel.

Whilst navigating the new site <a href="https://next.dogehouse.tv">https://dogehouse.tv</a> I found that navigating the site was a pain in the ass. I know, I know, It's still early days... but I'm a heavy clicker and I had to use the browsers back button to backtrack, which was just terrible UX.

We need a breadcrumb navigator up in here!

The only logical thing I could do here is infiltrate the Github repo, fork myself a copy, and attempt to see if they overlook my pull request & merge it in like suckers...

### Step 1 - Figure out how to even do that

I went and did some reading about contributing to open source, and the general gist I got is that I will be O.K. and my code will not be judged too harshly (lets see about that, they havn't seen my dumpster fires yet).

Reading through the README of the Dogehouse repository, it looks like they have an entire section dedicated to <a href="https://github.com/benawad/dogehouse/blob/staging/CONTRIBUTING.md">contributions</a>!

Okay... okay...

Code of conduct... ignore that...

Standards... ignore that...

Emojis... not what I am after...

Quickstart Local Frontend Development! That's what I'm after!!

### Step 2 - Pulling down the code

Okay... So I clicked the fork button, and apparently forked it to my account.

Then I pulled the sucker down to my local machine...

`git clone https://github.com/christopher-talke/dogehouse.git`

20.27MiB later... and there we go, the code was on my machine!

I went ahead and opened VS Code `cd dogehouse && code .`

### Step 3 - Starting the local dev environment

Ok, so the contributions file about Frontend Development said that I just needed to navigate to the `/kofta` directory, and run some arbitrary code.

`rm -rf ~/*`

Just kidding...

`npm i && npm run start:staging`

Beautiful... just as expected, I was up and running...

### Step 4 - Looking through the code
