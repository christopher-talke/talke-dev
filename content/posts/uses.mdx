I'm constantly improving and upgrading my setup, so expect this to change in the future.

If you want to know more details or have any questions, just get in touch!

## üåè Web Tech

**Backend** - My 'in general' poison of choice is `JavaScript`, so naturally I lean towards using NodeJS for any server side code. I typically reach for Express for my framework of choice, and have reached out to Koa in the past since they are so similar. Currently projects that I look after use the following technology:

- NodeJS
- Vanilla PHP & Wordpress
- REST API's via Express/Koa
- GraphQL using Apollo GraphQL
- SSR is either done via NextJS or EJS

**Frontend** - Depending on the project I will almost always reach for ReactJS, mostly because I love using it. However, if the job is very simple then vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript will do. Currently projects that I look after use the following technology:

- HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- ReactJS, NextJS and GatsbyJS

**Databases** - Postgres, always bet on postgres... (and sometimes SQLite)?

**Cloud Providers** - Vultr, Azure or Linode are my cloud providers of choice! I love me some linux üêß, so all of my VPSs are based on Ubuntu 18.04!

## üë©‚Äçüíª Editor, Terminal, Theme, Font & Extensions

**Visual Studio Code** - VS Code is my editor of choice, I've been using it for approx. two (2) years now and couldn't be happier. I did previously use a mix of Atom, and Brackets, however, I was never happy with either of them.

**Hyper** - My terminal of choice is <a href="https://hyper.is/">Hyper</a>, Initially I didn't like using it as it was a little bit buggy. However, it's grown on me and I use it pretty much all day everyday!

**Dracula Theme** - My theme of choice for both VS Code and Hyper is the <a href="https://draculatheme.com/">Dracula theme</a>!

**Font** - In Hyper is use the default font family, however, in VS Code I use `Cascadia Code` and I've been using this font for a good 7-8 months now. No r**a**grets!

**Extensions** - I have a ton of extensions installed right now, but the ones I cannot go without are: Apollo GraphQL, Docker, ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets, Import Cost, Material Icon Theme, Prettier and vscode-styled-components

## üíª Devices, Monitors etc

**Desktop** - Custom built computer w/ Windows 10 Pro, it holds an Intel i7, 32GB DDR3 System Memory, 2x 256GB SATA Solid State Drives in a RAID0, 1x 1TB SATA Hard Disk Drive (Local Backups) with a Nvidia GTX1080. This is primarily my gaming machine, however, I do use it for development for time to time!

**Laptop** - A work issued Lenovo X1 Carbon G6 w/ Windows 10 Pro, it is an Intel i7 with 16GB DDR4 System Memory, 512GB M.2 Solid State Drive, and a 14" WQHD LED IPS Display. It also comes with WWAN (4G/LTE) built in, I'm on the road a fair bit for my day job so this is very helpful!

**Docking Station** - Also work issued, I have a Lenovo ThunderBolt 3 Gen2 Docking Station so I can plugin to everything with one cable!

**Monitors** - I'm currently using two (2) Asus PB278Q's which are 27" IPS LED WQHD Monitors with a resolution of 2560 x 1440. I've had these for a few years now, and they are getting old but they are still very good and the clarity of these displays are awesome!

**Phone** - Apple iPhone 8 Plus üì±

**Headphones** - Airpods ü§£

**Servers** - Yes... server**s**... I currently have a total of three (3) 'servers'. One Dell R710 Server, which is a second hand server I bought online. This server is currently in storage, however, it was my primary homelab server for playing with anything Windows Server, Linux and so forth to keep my sys admin skills sharp!

I also have a custom built tower which is my Network Attached Storage (NAS) device, currently this supports a total of 7TB of storage and is made up of a bunch of mixed drives. This is made possible using an operating system called UnraidOS which is amazing!

My third server is my temporary replacement for the R710, this is a tiny Intel NUC with and Intel i5 Processor, 8GB DDR4 System Memory and a 512GB Hard Disk Drive. I'm currently using this as my media server, pihole, ddns and vpn tunnel client.

## üç¶ Software

**Auto Hot Key** - For all of my Windows automation I use a tool called Auto Hot Key (or better known AHK). This covers anything from macros, text expansion and so forth (automate all the things!).

**Figma** - For my design requirements, I use Figma. I've been using Figma for about a year now, and I couldn't be happier!

**Codesandbox** - For any quick projects, demos or tech help, I always reach for Codesandbox.io!

**Business Things** - Office 365

**Version Control** - My version control of choice is GIT, and I host all of my code on Github. For business stuff I primarily store my code on various BitBucket locations.

**Browser** - I'm currently using Google Chrome for both work and personal stuff, however, I'm slowly moving over to the new Microsoft Edge!
