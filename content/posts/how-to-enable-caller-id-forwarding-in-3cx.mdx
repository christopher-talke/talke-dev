Some use cases for this would be because:

- The end user wishes to divert calls to a sales person after hours, and retain the original callers number.
- The end user wishes to divert calls to personal mobile number when in Do Not Disturb, Lunch Break or other preferred status.
- Some other ungodly reason...

‚ö† Be Aware

This method is O.K. to use when the SIP Trunk provider does not require the <strong>AuthID</strong> parameter set for <strong>From : Display Name, From : User Part, Remote Part ID - Calling Party : Display Name</strong> or <strong>Remote Part ID - Calling Party : User Part</strong> in the <strong>SIP Trunk > Outbound Parameters</strong> settings.

This will also utilise 2 SIP Channels in the process (one for the inbound call, one for the outbound call), preferred method is the Mobile App.

In testing this there was a total of four (4) scenarios executed:

<strong>Scenario 1 - Forward External Call to External Number</strong> ‚úîÔ∏è Worked as expected

1. Party 1 called from Mobile Number to Demo Phone System
2. Party 2 transferred the call to a Mobile Number
3. Mobile Phone displayed Party 1 as the Caller ID


<strong>Scenario 2 - Do Not Disturb settings with forward to an External Number</strong> ‚úîÔ∏è Worked as expected

1. Party 1 setup a DnD Configuration to forward calls to an External Number, and set himself as DnD
2. Party 2 called from the Phone System to another Phone System
3. Party 2 answered the call, and transferred the number to Party 1's Extension, which forwarded the call to Party 1s Mobile
4. Party 1 recieved the call with a Caller ID presenting to him


<strong>Scenario 3 - After Hours settings with forward to an External Number</strong> ‚úîÔ∏è Worked as expected

1. Party 2 configured After-Hours settings to forward calls to an External Number
2. Party 2 called from another Phone System to Demo Phone System
3. Demo Phone System automatically forwarded the call to the Configured External Number
4. Party 2 recieved the call with a Caller ID presenting to him


<strong>Scenario 4 - Passing External Call to Internal Extension then Forward to External Number</strong> üö© Worked as 'expected', but didn't pass on the Original Callers ID

1. Party 1 called the Demo Phone System from his mobile
2. Party 1 answered the call, and transferred it to Party 2' Extension
3. Party 2 answered the call, and transferred it to External Number (Mobile)
4. Party 2 recieved the call with a Caller ID presenting to him (This happened because 3CX reconigsed the Original Caller ID being the internal extension's, not the original caller).

### üîß Configuration steps

<div className="alert danger">
‚Äº Please Ensure

There is a current backup available in the event you have to roll settings back!!!!
</div>


1. Log into the Management Console (https://client.3cx.com.au/)
2. Go to 'SIP Trunk'
3. Go to 'Outbound Parameters'
4. Change 'Remote Party ID' from 'OutboundCallerId' to 'OriginatorCallerID'
5. Scroll back up and click OK. **Note this will force a refresh of the SIP trunk registration which will drop all active calls**
6. Done

Suggest setting up a temporary DnD rule, or testing the after-hours forwarding rule to see if it has applied correctly.
