Offloading core infrastructure to public cloud solutions such as Office 365's Hosted Exchange (Exchange Online) or migrating Company Data to a Hosted SharePoint service (SharePoint Online) has been a pretty common move across the SMB Market here in Australia.

There are more and more businesses moving their traditional Windows <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/folder-redirection/folder-redirection-rup-overview">Folder Redirection</a> solutions to a feature included with OneDrive known as <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/redirect-known-folders">Windows Known Folders</a> so instead of being redirect to an on-premises server drive location, it is pushed to Microsoft's Cloud!

Now - this push been great for environments where all devices are local, however, the challenge really starts to set in when you're expected to configure this in a remote environment with one (or many) Remote Desktop Session Host(s). This also lies true with newer Virtual Desktop solutions such as the recent push by Microsoft for <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-desktop/">Windows Virtual Desktop (WVD)</a>.

So what is this challenge you ask? 

If you're here, you probably know the answer...

It's Storage.

**Some Background**<br />
We recently had a client move their old infrastructure into a hosted environment with multiple Remote Desktop Session Hosts (RDSHs) utilising Windows Server 2019, and a new technology recently aquired by Microsoft known as FSLogix.

FSLogix was the foundation of this solution as it allowed full utilisation of the Office 365 Suite, without running into the problems that typically occurred with the traditional Microsoft User Profile Disk (UPD) approach.

Long story short, we needed FSLogix to do Office 365 things, and it all worked, and the client was happy, and things were great... until...

The FSLogix UPD's started growing like crazy, for a multitude of reasons, however, the biggest one being growth of User Profile Disks due to the lack of data purging, offline files that were no longer being used and more end user problems related to data-hoarding.

For an Internal IT Team, there would normally be internal rules about this type of end-user behavior, however, as an external consultant this is difficult to uphold.

So what is the solution here? How is storage handled on Windows 10 for local devices? It's handled with Storage Sense and Files On-Demand!

**What is Storage Sense / Files On-Demand?**<br/>
Storage Sense is the Disk Cleanup replacement. It frees up space on your device by deleting things like recycle bin contents, temporary internet files, app temporary files and the ever elusive Downloads folder based on your preferences.

With Storage Sense there also comes Files On-Demand, this feature has the capability to automatically free up disk space by making older, unused, locally available OneDrive files be available online-only. Your files will still be safe in OneDrive and represented as placeholders on your device. We call this process “dehydration”. Your online-only files will still be visible on your device. When connected to the internet, you’ll be able to use online-only files just like any other file.

To handle this on traditional Windows 10 Desktops in a corporate domain you can configure these preferences using Group Policy Objects (GPOs) via the available ADMX files, however, for our use case (and at the time of writing this post) these prepared templates do not currently work with Windows Server 2019.

Windows Server 2019 **does** have the necessary registry keys and values to change these preferences on the fly via a GPO, however, this is limited and will not allow you to configure Files On-Demand for OneDrive or any mapped SharePoint Document Libraries.

At this point the only other solution available to fix this is via Powershell.

**Finding the solution**
If you know how to Google well enough, you'll usually stumble across an answer or at least find a bread trail to your solution.

First we needed to find the location of the Storage Sense preferences, and after some searching we found that these keys live here:

`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\StorageSense\Parameters\StoragePolicy`

Once you get here you will notice a bunch of items with REG_DWORD hexidecimal values set (see below picture).

If you mess around enough with the Windows 10 Settings for Storage Sense, you can quickly understand what each of these items does (except for that Elusive '02'). Below is a table that I came across which was very helpful in my pursuit to get Storage Sense automatically configured across our Remote Desktop Servers.

|Setting  | Value  | Option  | Hex Value  |
|---|---|---|---|
| Enable Storage Sense  |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |
