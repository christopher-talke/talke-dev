#### Background

Recently a friendly Canadian chap you may or may not know (<a href="https://wesbos.com">Wes Bos</a>), posted some stuff about Cloudflare Workers on twitter and he also made a really interesting video about how he used this for himself (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48NWaLkDcME">Video Here</a>), anyway, then a few days later he made this post:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    I just thought of another use case for Cloudflare Workers. <br />
    <br />
    If you own a domain and point it at a service (status page, screenshot host,
    mail client), you can use a worker to inject your own custom .js and .css
    onto the page. <br />
    <br />
    It&#39;s like myspace all over again

This particular tweet really caught my attention, because I've recently figured out how to do the same thing with NGINX to create my own SaaS to SaaS integration. To get this done I had to do a ton of searching, so I figured why not write about it to make someone elses life a bit easier. I am going to generalise here
